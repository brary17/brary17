<h2 id="about-me">🔍 About Me</h2>
Hi! I’m Braxton Geary, a Computer Science researcher passionate about advancing **Artificial Intelligence** and **Reinforcement Learning**. My work focuses on creating intelligent systems that make decisions under uncertainty, with applications in robotics, multi-agent systems, and energy-efficient transportation.  

I’m currently completing my **MS in Computer Science** at Utah State University and applying to PhD programs, where I hope to deepen my research in decision-making algorithms and multi-agent collaboration. I’m always eager to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI and its real-world impact.

I love learning and trying new things!  Several months ago I switched to Linux (Ubuntu) because a certain OS deleted all my college notes and I wanted to learn more about computers.  At the beginning of this year (2025), I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux to dive further into the nitty-gritty of what goes on in a computer. I've loved it and don't plan on going back anytime soon!  As an added perk, I can now use the holy mantra of all Arch users ("BTW, I use Arch")

I’ve collaborated on impactful projects across diverse domains. Here are some highlights:

### 1. [**DelayRL-PCSE**](https://github.com/gavinedd/DelayRL-PCSE)
- Developed a **reinforcement learning framework** to model decision-making under delayed feedback in farming scenarios. This project explores how farmers can share information to optimize resource use.

### 2. [**RoboticInstructionLLM**](https://github.com/Isaacwilliam4/RoboticInstructionLLM)
- Contributed to research on **large language models (LLMs)** for robotic instruction, helping bridge the gap between human intent and machine actions.

### 3. [**Spot Robot Fun**](https://github.com/USUBadBatch/5510-spot)
- Part of a team building control systems and applications for **Boston Dynamics Spot**, focusing on practical robotics applications.
